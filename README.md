# AI Native Dev Landscape - Data
## Introduction
The AI Native Dev Landscape is a project by [AI Native Dev](https://ainativedev.io) to help developers keep track of the AI tools and technologies that are available. It is a community curated list and we welcome contributions.

This repository contains the data that powers the [https://landscape.ainativedev.io](https://landscape.ainativedev.io) website.

## Terminology
- The whole dataset is referred to as `Landscape`.
- The landscape consists of different `Domains`.
- Each domain has multiple `Categories`.
- And under categories we have `Tools`
