# Contributing to the AI Native Dev Landscape

## Adding a new tool

To add a new tool to the landscape, you can follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Add or update the tool under `aind-landing-Page/public/tools-data.yaml` (the json one is autogenerated on deploy)
3. Create a pull request

## Alternate workflow
### Official vendor verification
- If you are a vendor and want to get your tool verified or change some of the tools information, please fill in this [Official Tool Vendor - Google Form](https://forms.gle/6NV7g8UvAq4py8KK8).

- If contributing via a PR is not your preferred method, you can also open up a Github Issue or send us an email at [hello@ainativedev.io](mailto:hello@ainativedev.io)

## Add or update a new domain or category

To add a new domain or category to the landscape, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a Github issue for discussion
2. Once the discussion is settled, create a pull request to add the new domain or category to the landscape. Make sure it has a consistent `level` with the rest of the landscape.

## Guidelines
- We tend to avoid having single tool categories, so if you are adding a new category, make sure it has more than 3 tools associated with it.
- We tend to avoid putting tools in multiple categories, so if a tool is a good fit for multiple categories, try to pick the most specific one.
