You can then review the changes in your code and commit the results. Modifications to the LST are performed in Visitors and visitors are aggregated into Recipes.

We've built an autonomous development solution that seamlessly integrates with your existing workflow in under 5 minutes. We connect to GitHub, Jira, and other tools you already use.\n\nUnlike other solutions that focus on the inner loop, we're tackling the outer loop - that overflowing backlog of P2 bugs and features that never get addressed because your team is constantly chasing the next deadline. You simply assign Bismuth to a ticket, and it autonomously produces high-quality PRs that fix issues or implement features. Bismuth also prevents issues from ever getting to prod, we scan your codebase and review pull requests for bugs and logic issues.\n\nWhat makes us different is our background in code analysis, reverse engineering, and bug hunting. Our custom code search and special testing methodologies catch entire classes of bugs that other solutions miss. We don't just generate code, we create reliable, tested PRs that won't break your codebase.\n\nTech debt cost businesses $1.52T in 2024 alone, with 63% spent on reactive fixes after incidents occurred.

Key capabilities include generating infrastructure code from simple prompts, identifying cost-saving opportunities, running compliance checks, and debugging failed stack updates.\n\nAdditionally, Copilot now offers an API that extends its capabilities beyond the Pulumi Console. This REST API allows developers to integrate Copilot's infrastructure AI into custom tools, collaboration platforms like Slack and Teams, automated workflows, and mobile clients. The API supports multi-turn conversations through conversation IDs and requires only basic configuration with organization context and resource URLs to function.
