You simply assign Bismuth to a ticket, and it autonomously produces high-quality PRs that fix issues or implement features. Bismuth also prevents issues from ever getting to prod, we scan your codebase and review pull requests for bugs and logic issues.  What makes us different is our background in code analysis, reverse engineering, and bug hunting. Our custom code search and special testing methodologies catch entire classes of bugs that other solutions miss. We don't just generate code, we create reliable, tested PRs that won't break your codebase.  Tech debt cost businesses $1.52T in 2024 alone, with 63% spent on reactive fixes after incidents occurred.

Given the success of retrieval-augmented generation in many text-oriented tasks, providing external resources such as library documentation or tutorials can facilitate code generation as well. Despite a few efforts on this, retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) is still under-explored on various tasks and retrieval sources.  In this work, we conduct a systematic, large-scale analysis by asking: in what scenarios can current retrievers benefit code generation models? and what challenges do they have? We first curate a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, CodeRAG-Bench, encompassing three categories of code generation tasks, including general programming, open-domain, and repository-level problems. We also aggregate documents from five sources for models to retrieve contexts from: competition solutions, online tutorials, library documentation, StackOverflow posts, and GitHub repositories.  We examine top-performing models on CodeRAG-Bench by providing contexts retrieved from each or multiple sources. Although high-quality contexts can benefit code generation, current retrieval models often struggle to fetch useful contexts, and generation models minimally improve when having limited context lengths or RAG abilities. We hope the community uses CodeRAG-Bench as an effective testbed and continues to build better code-oriented RAG systems to leverage the full power of RACG.","","https://code-rag-bench.github.io/",true,false,false,"OSS;GA;Code Benchmark;AIE","",""
